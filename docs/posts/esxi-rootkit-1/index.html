<p>For some time now, I&rsquo;ve been told that ESXi VMkernel is <strong>NOT</strong> Linux.  After some research into developing user mode (or user world, as VMware calls it) tools, I finally understood what that meant.  I won&rsquo;t be going into all of the differences in this series but for those who are curious, <a href="https://microage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ESXi_architecture.pdf">this whitepaper on ESXi architecture</a> is a good starting point.  My mind started to drift away from user mode tools to kernel mode security tools.  The only real resources I was able to find online were those related to things like USB and NIC drivers.  VMkernel is able to run some Linux kernel modules, but not all.
